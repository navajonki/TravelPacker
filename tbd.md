## Bugs
- [x] Editing a bag / traveler / category
- [x] Remove the grabby thing
- [x] The things that appear in the items should always be of the types on the other two tabs - so if you're looking at Bags, the tags on the items should be category & traveler
- [x] Theme shouldn't be mandatory
- [x] Each list doesn't need a + on the top right
- [x] Remove New List button when looking at an existing list
- [x] Fix user login
- [x] Why is it so laggy?
- [x] Packed items shouldn't change their place in the lists
- [ ] Implement pack / unpack all
- [x] Add new Traveler modal is broken
- [x] Edit item modal is broken
- [x] Edit individual item doesnt' do anything
- [x] Edit multiple modal is broken
- [ ] A user who has access to the list should be able to do anything in it - add / remove bags, categories, etc.
- [x] Add item within containers should either work or be removed
- [ ] Collaboration shouldn't be it's own tab
- [x] Delete stuff from unassigned
- [ ] Bulk edit modal should allow for deletion

## Papercuts
- [x] Top header in list view is redundant and takes up too much space. Everything should be in one line.
- [x] Menu at the top right doesn't do anything
- [ ] Filters should stay when navigating away
- [ ] Modals should take up 1/4 of screen width on the right
- [ ] Filters tab looks awkward on mobile
- [x] Dropdowns should have a select all / none toggle
- [x] After an item is selected from the dropdown, it should stay open so people can check / uncheck multiple ones at the same time
- [x] Back to Lists shouldn't show in when looking at all packing lists
- [ ] In search dropdown, order should be person, category, bag
- [ ] Invitations shouldn't expire
- [x] Bulk edit the stuff in unassigned
- [x] When adding a new item, Cateogry should also be able to be none
- [ ] Add items should look and feel the same

## Features
- [x] Searching within the given packing list
- [ ] Rearrange items on the lists
- [x] New item entry fields should go away when not in use. There should just be a big plus button, when you tap on that those fields all pop up
- [x] Ability to collaborate
- [ ] Copy list
- [ ] Create "On Person" category that doesn't count toward packing completion
- [ ] Shift-click should select all items in between previously selected item and next tapped one
