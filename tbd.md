## Bugs
- [ ] Editing a bag / traveler / category
- [ ] Remove the grabby thing

- [ ] Each list doesn't need a + on the top right
- [ ] Back to Lists shouldn't show in when looking at all packing lists

- [x] Fix user login
- [x] Why is it so laggy?
- [ ] Filters should stay when navigating away
- [ ] Packed items shouldn't change their place in the lists

- [ ] Dropdowns should have a select all / none toggle


## Features
- [ ] Searching within the given packing list
